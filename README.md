## setup

Clone this repo, then in your virtual environment (Python 3.7+):

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
From here, I can already link this environment to Jupyter via VSCode automatically, but failing that, you'll also want to install jupyter:
```
python3 -m pip install jupyter
python3 -m jupyter notebook  # run!
```
